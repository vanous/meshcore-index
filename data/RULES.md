# Contributing data

How to fill the atlas data well — for **anyone** editing the YAML under `data/`,
human or agent.

- **What fields exist:** [`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md) (field reference).
- **Machine contracts:** [`../schema/`](../schema/) (JSON Schema sources).
- **This file:** the conventions and judgement calls that the schema can't enforce.

Authored site content is YAML under `data/`. Generated enrichment overlays may
live in sibling `data.json` files; the app reads a compiled
`src/lib/generated/data.json`, built from both layers.

## Validate your changes

```bash
npm test              # validate all YAML against JSON Schema + referential checks
npm run build:data    # regenerate data.json and generated record JSON
```

Run **`npm test`** after every data change. `build:data` runs automatically via
the dev/build hooks, but run it by hand after changing `data/globals.yaml`.
Schema JSON is published into `build/schema/` by `npm run build` / `npm run build:schema`;
do not commit generated schema JSON under `static/`.

## Directory layout

```
data/devices/<id>/device.yaml    # id = directory name (kebab-case), not in YAML
data/devices/<id>/<image>.svg    # thumbnail (optional)
data/devices/<id>/datasheet.pdf  # vendor spec PDF (optional, immutable copy)
data/firmwares/<id>/firmware.yaml
data/firmwares/<id>/data.json    # generated overlay, e.g. GitHub popularity (optional)
data/vendors/<id>/vendor.yaml
data/networks/<id>/network.yaml  # a regional/national MeshCore mesh
data/networks/<id>/area.geojson  # optional Leaflet area shape for the network map
data/globals.yaml                # MCU/radio/display/GNSS/frequency catalog
data/redirects.yaml              # old-slug → current-slug for renamed records
```

## Renaming a record (redirects)

A record's URL is its directory name (`/firmware/<id>`, `/device/<id>`, …). If
you rename a directory, the old URL breaks. Keep it working by adding the old
slug to [`data/redirects.yaml`](redirects.yaml) under the matching collection —
`<old-slug>: <current-slug>`. The build prerenders each old slug as a 301 to the
record's current page. `npm test` fails if the target doesn't exist or the old
slug collides with a live record. Prefer stable slugs; use redirects only when a
rename is unavoidable.

A device counts as supported by a firmware only when it's listed in that
firmware's `devices[]` (`data/firmwares/<id>/firmware.yaml`) — not merely by
having a device record.

A **network** lists no devices: its compatible-hardware list is derived from
`radio.frequency` or the union of `radios[].frequency` band keys (each key must
exist in `data/globals.yaml` `frequency`, e.g. `"868"`). Keep networks to
organized meshes (national/regional/local/experimental) — not individual repeaters. See the Network table in
[`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md#adding-a-network).

If a network has a published coverage/coordination footprint, put it in a
separate GeoJSON file (usually `area.geojson`) beside `network.yaml` and set
`area: area.geojson`. Keep the YAML human-readable; detailed coordinates belong
in the GeoJSON.

Keep `analyzers` for CoreScope analyzer instances only, with the bare root
domain (no path/query/hash). Put dashboards, health checks, observer status
pages, docs and other tools under `resources.links`.

## Enriching a device

1. Read the vendor **product page**, the **datasheet PDF**, and vendor docs/wiki
   when linked.
2. Copy structure from a **similar enriched device** (see templates) — don't
   invent a sparse partial YAML.
3. Add `# Source:` with the product page URL; add a second `# Source:` line for a
   datasheet or docs URL when helpful.
4. Fill **all applicable structured fields** — not just `description` prose.
5. If the device's MCU, radio chip, GNSS module, or display technology isn't in
   `data/globals.yaml` yet, **add a catalog entry** in the same change — don't
   leave a bare string or substitute the wrong closest match.
6. If the vendor publishes a spec PDF, **commit it locally and link it in YAML**
   (see Datasheets) — don't leave the URL in a comment.

### Templates (copy from these)

| Device kind | Start from |
|-------------|------------|
| Heltec ESP32 + LoRa (V3/V4/T190) | `heltec-v3`, `heltec-v4`, `heltec-t190` |
| Heltec nRF52 + LoRa (T114) | `heltec-t114` |
| Seeed tracker / node | `wio-tracker-l1`, `sensecap-t1000e` |
| Elecrow ThinkNode | `thinknode-m2`, `thinknode-m1` |
| LilyGo handheld | `lilygo-t-deck`, `lilygo-techo` |

### Naming

Keep **`name` as short as possible** — what you'd say out loud or fit on a card.
Drop vendor marketing filler that doesn't distinguish the product.

**Use `name` for the short label:**
- `Heltec T114` not `Heltec Mesh Node T114`
- `Heltec T190` not `Heltec Vision Master T190`
- `Heltec V3` not `Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3`
- `LilyGo T-Echo` not `LilyGo T-Echo LILYGO`
- `ThinkNode M2 Mini` when that's the distinct SKU

**Put in `aliases`** (not `name`): formal product titles, module codes, old
names. Examples: `Mesh Node T114`, `Vision Master T190`, `WiFi LoRa 32 V3`,
`HT-VMT190`.

**Vendor prefix:** include when it disambiguates (`Seeed Studio Wio Tracker L1`,
`Elecrow ThinkNode M1`). Omit when the brand is obvious or the line is already
unique (`Heltec V3`, `LilyGo T-Deck`, `Heltec T190`).

- Device **id** stays kebab-case and stable (`heltec-v3`, not renamed for marketing).
- **`kind`**: `dev-board` for bare development boards; `product` for finished
  handhelds/enclosed products; `kit` for bundled kits (see `heltec-v4-exp`).

### Category

`category` answers "what is this board *for*?" — it drives filtering on the
device list. Pick the value that best describes the device as purchased/built.

| Value | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `module` | A radio module or system-on-module intended to be soldered or socketed into another design. Use `moduleType: radio` for RF-only PCBs (no general-purpose MCU); `moduleType: system` for MCU + radio modules intended for integration. | Ebyte E22P, Seeed Wio-SX1262, HopeRF RFM95 (radio); RAK3172, Seeed WM1110 (system) |
| `development-board` | Requires assembly, a host system, or non-trivial configuration before it does anything useful. Includes bare dev boards, HATs/shields, base boards that need an MCU, and kits sold as build projects. | Heltec V3, PiMesh-1W (needs a Pi), Photon-1W (needs a Xiao MCU), Zindello UltraPeater (kit) |
| `companion-radio` | A finished consumer device — with enclosure and usually a battery — whose primary purpose is to pair with a phone/tablet as a MeshCore BLE/USB companion radio. Ready to use out of the box. | T-Echo, Wio Tracker L1 Pro |
| `standalone` | A complete, self-contained device that runs MeshCore without any host. Plug in power and it works — no assembly, no MCU to add. | A fully enclosed repeater with fixed firmware |
| `repeater` | A finished, dedicated repeater with enclosure — sold or built specifically for that role, not a general-purpose board that can be flashed as one. | A sealed outdoor repeater node sold ready-to-deploy |
| `tracker` | A device built primarily for GPS position tracking and telemetry. Has enclosure and battery like a companion-radio, but the primary use is position reporting rather than serving as a phone companion. | SenseCAP T1000-E, SenseCAP Card Tracker T1000-E, Wio Tracker L1 |
| `other` | Doesn't fit any of the above. Use sparingly. | |

**Common mistakes:**
- Do **not** use `companion-radio` for bare boards, HATs, or radio modules — it is reserved for finished consumer devices with enclosure and (usually) battery. HATs → `development-board`; bare radio PCBs → `module`.
- Do **not** use `module` for full dev boards that happen to have "module" in the name — if it has USB, buttons, and a regulator, it's `development-board`.
- Do **not** use `repeater` for kits or dev boards that can run repeater firmware — use `development-board` and set `roles: [repeater]` instead.
- Do **not** use `standalone` unless the device works out of the box with no host, no assembly, and no MCU to add.

### Description

Keep **`description` short** — one or two sentences (~200–350 characters), like
the hero blurb on the device page. Say **what the product is** and one or two
distinguishing hooks (outdoor node, kit bundle, optional LoRa SKU).

**Do not repeat structured fields** — battery capacity, IP rating, connector
types, display size, antenna ports, and USB details belong in the YAML spec
blocks, not in prose.

**Good examples:** `wio-tracker-l1`, `heltec-v3`, `heltec-t190`
**Too long:** restating expansion connectors, mAh, certifications, or antenna
ports already captured elsewhere.

### URLs & datasheets

- `product_url`: vendor **marketing/product page** (external, may change).
- `datasheet`: **local PDF filename** in the device directory — not a URL.

Datasheets work like thumbnails: a **file in the device directory** plus a
**field in `device.yaml`**. The site links them on the device page.

```yaml
image: heltec_v3.svg          # only if the .svg file exists in the directory
datasheet: datasheet.pdf      # required when you have a vendor PDF
```

When you find a vendor PDF during enrichment:

1. `curl -o data/devices/<id>/datasheet.pdf '<vendor-url>'`
2. Add `datasheet: datasheet.pdf` in `device.yaml`
3. Run `npm test` — validation fails if `datasheet` is set but the file is missing

**Do not** put `# Datasheet: https://…` in comments — that does not create a link.
Heltec PDFs usually live under `https://resource.heltec.cn/download/<product>/`.

### Prices

- `price.amount`: round to **whole USD** (e.g. `$39.90` → `40`, not `17.9`).
- `price.asOf`: `YYYY-MM` (e.g. `2026-06`).
- Omit `price` entirely when the shop only shows "add to cart" with no fixed USD.

### Built-in vs optional hardware

Read the spec table and packing list carefully. **Do not guess from checkout
options alone.**

| Pattern | YAML approach | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Always on board** | `display.status: present` with size/resolution/controller | T190 1.9″ TFT, V3 OLED |
| **Optional at purchase** (common SKU has it) | `display.status: present` + note "optional" in `description` | T114 with display variant |
| **Add-on module only** | `gnss.status: none` + `expansion` for connector/module | T114 L76K, V4 GNSS header |
| **Built-in GNSS** | `gnss.status: present` + `chip` | T1000-E AG3335, T-Echo L76K |

**Do not remove `display: present`** on boards that ship with a display in the
catalogued SKU (e.g. T114 with TFT) — when enriching for MeshCore, that's usually
the configuration meant.

Optional **LoRa** at purchase: still document `radios[]` for the MeshCore target
board; mention an optional/no-LoRa SKU in `description` only.

### Variants and revisions

Use device-root `variants[]` for purchasable options of the same catalogued
device. If the manufacturer sells each hardware revision + band combination
under a distinct SKU, list each combination as its own variant even when that
looks repetitive — the SKU is the real-world purchasable unit.

```yaml
revision: '3' # broad/default generation for the device page
variants:
  - name: V3.0 433MHz
    revision: '3.0'
    sku: ZC-152-2-433
    bands:
      - '433'
  - name: V3.1 863~870MHz
    revision: '3.1'
    sku: ZC-153-2-868
    bands:
      - '868'
```

- `hardware.radios[].bands` remains the union of every band offered by the
  purchasable variants.
- `variants[].bands` is the band or bands for that exact SKU.
- `variants[].revision` is the hardware revision for that exact SKU when known.
- Use separate device records only when revisions meaningfully change firmware
  compatibility, pinout, radio/FEM, display, GNSS, power, physical specs, or
  another important hardware behavior.

### Fields to fill when enriching

Use the **datasheet**, not just the shop blurb.

| Area | Fill in |
|------|---------|
| MCU | `model`, `flashMb`, `psramMb` when applicable |
| Radio | all band keys from spec (`433`, `470`, `868`, `915`), `txPowerDbm`, `antenna` |
| Display | `status`, `technology`, `controller`, `size`, `resolution`, `colors` |
| Power | `batterySupported`, `batteryBuiltIn`, `batteryConnector`, `charging`, `solarInput` |
| Physical | `dimensionsMm`, `weightG` from spec table |
| USB | `connector` (usually `USB-C` on current boards — never leave `unknown` if known) |
| Expansion | concrete `type` (`header-2.54`, `gnss-1.25-8`, `quicklink-sh1.0-4p`) — not generic `connector` |
| Image | `image: foo.svg` **only** if `data/devices/<id>/foo.svg` exists |

Skip redundant fields: don't set `display.touch: false`, don't duplicate
datasheet URLs in comments.

### Catalog (`data/globals.yaml`)

Devices store bare part keys (e.g. `hardware.mcu.model: esp32-s3`); the site
resolves friendly names, vendor links, and derived fields (MCU family,
architecture) from **`data/globals.yaml`**. Unmatched keys still render, but as
raw text with no link — **fix that when you notice it**.

**When enriching a device, if a part isn't catalogued yet, add it** — same PR as
the device YAML. Copy an existing entry's shape; use the vendor's formal name
and product-page URL from the datasheet.

| Device field | Globals section | Example key |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `hardware.mcu.model` | `family.<id>.models` (or new family) | `esp32-s3`, `nrf52840` |
| `hardware.radios[].chip` | `radio` | `sx1262`, `lr1110` |
| `hardware.gnss.chip` | `gnss` | `L76K`, `AG3335` |
| `hardware.display.technology` | `display` | `oled`, `e-paper` |

**MCU specifics:** devices specify only `model`; family and CPU architecture are
derived from globals. When a family id also names a specific chip (e.g. `esp32`
is both the series and the original ESP32), register it under `models` too —
lookup prefers the **model** entry over the family fallback.

Adding entries is **additive** — don't rename or remove existing keys. Run
`npm test` after editing globals (schema-validated like device YAML).

### Battery & card badges

- `batterySupported: true` alone = external connector support, **not** a built-in pack.
- Don't expect a "Battery" card badge for connector-only support; badges show
  **`batteryCapacityMah`** (e.g. `850 mAh`) when a built-in capacity is known.
- `batteryBuiltIn: true` + `batteryCapacityMah` for integrated cells.
- Solar: `solarPanelBuiltIn: true` for an integrated panel (drives the "Solar"
  badge); `solarInput: true` is just the ability to attach a panel.

### Display & UI roles

- `standalone-ui` role when the device has a usable on-device display for firmware UI.
- Display size in YAML drives hero/cards (e.g. `0.96″ OLED`, `1.9″ display`).
- Include `controller` (e.g. `ST7789`, `SSD1306`) when the datasheet names it.

### Common pitfalls

- Match **radio chip** to hardware (V2 = SX1276, V3/V4/T114/T190 = SX1262 — ignore wrong titles on shop pages).
- `interfaces.wifi.status: none` when there is no Wi-Fi (LR1110 Wi-Fi *scan* for positioning is not user Wi-Fi).
- **Heltec ESP32-S3R8** boards often have **16 MB flash + 8 MB PSRAM** — check the datasheet, don't leave MCU bare.
- Only add schema fields that exist in `schema/device.yaml` — run `npm test`.
- Keep diffs focused; don't bulk-edit every device unless asked.
- **Don't "correct" display to `unknown`** on boards the catalog treats as having a screen without checking intent.
- **Don't revert or strip** existing enrichment without reviewing against the datasheet first.
- **Don't skip `globals.yaml`** when a device uses a new MCU, radio, GNSS, or display
  technology — add the catalog entry so the site can link and resolve it.

## Contributor checklist

- [ ] Datasheet PDF downloaded + `datasheet: datasheet.pdf` (when a vendor PDF exists)
- [ ] No `# Datasheet:` URL comments
- [ ] MCU flash/PSRAM, radio bands, display specs, USB connector, physical dims filled from datasheet
- [ ] New MCU/radio/GNSS/display keys added to `data/globals.yaml` when missing
- [ ] `image:` only if the SVG file exists in the device directory
- [ ] Display/GNSS reflect built-in vs add-on correctly
- [ ] Price rounded to whole USD, or omitted if the shop has no fixed price
- [ ] `# Source:` comment(s) with product page (+ docs URL if used)
